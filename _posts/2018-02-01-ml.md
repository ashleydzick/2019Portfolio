Thanks everyone who was able to make it to [BCUXâ€™s January meetup](https://www.meetup.com/brewcityux/events/257286694/) where Nick Gartmann and I gave mini talks on Machine Learning. We had a great turn out of over 40 people!

You can find my slides on [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ashleydzick/solving-what-to-solve-ux-plus-machine-learning).
