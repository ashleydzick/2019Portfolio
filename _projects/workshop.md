## Summary
The client, a retailer and manufacturer of apparel, was looking to revolutionize the apparel customization process. They wanted to craft an experience that was intuitive, easy to use and fun. Their users ranged from well-informed internal sales people to soccer moms who stumbled across their site while searching on their phone.

The engagement kicked off with an in-person workshop but otherwise was entirely remote. I provided desktop guidance and review and developed the mobile experience.

## Process
### Design Workshop
I remixed several different design workshop methodologies to come up with the 3 Day Launch Plan. The launch plan aims to gather together the right people for the right amount of time and leave with an actionable plan. Design Sprint and IBM’s Design Thinking are combined with some of my activities and a brief “future state” so the team leaves with an actual plan.

For this client, I tailored the design workshop to their specific needs. We used divergent and convergent exercises to gather the team’s thoughts, performed a competitive analysis, identified novel ideas, gathered stakeholder buy-in and left with a feature list and basic wireframes.

* Competitive Analysis
* Workflows
* Sketching and Wireframing
* Storyboarding

### Mentorship and Mobile Design
After the workshop, I worked with the client in an advisory capacity, performing heuristic evaluations and guidance for their desktop mockups. In the interest of time, the client had me then take their designs and create mobile-friendly mockups that the developers could leverage.

* Heuristic Evaluation
* Design Reviews
* Mobile Design
  
## Results
The client was able to focus their project and deliver designs much faster to developers. They learned new tools and technologies to leverage when creating responsive designs.
