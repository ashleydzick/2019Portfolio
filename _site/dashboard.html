				## Summary
The client, an established insurance provider, was actively looking to expand into new markets. After some market research, they discovered that only 10% of millennials reported they have enough life insurance to cover needs in case of death. This audience hasn’t responded to their traditional product lines, so something new was needed.

The client wanted to build a data and research-driven dashboard and mobile app that they could leverage to target millennials. I worked with the client in 2018 through early 2019, assisting with their research strategy, IA, dashboard, and some basic data visualization. 

--- 

## Process

### Research Strategy
The client’s marketing team already had a great vision, SWOT and product strategy in place. I wanted to revisit their research to understand the market better and also offer insights from a UX perspective.

We began with a Brand Sort to envision how the team felt its offering could impact the new market. The team was less cohesive than they had self-reported; this was a perfect activity to help them see their different visions and come together. At the end of the brand sort, we had a series of cards and messaging the entire team could get behind.

Next, I looked at comparable products targeting millennials and established a brief competitive analysis focused on UX. Most products were overly simplified and focused on the “shiny” factor. Life insurance is a financial investment — the competitor’s positioning almost felt insulting. I was confident that we could leverage our application to educate millennials without calling them stupid. 

Finally, we established an analytics strategy. Designs were implemented and developed iteratively; an analytics strategy would help us keep the team focused on the best possible enhancements. The analytics strategy consisted of specific, measurable insights that we would tie to KPIs. We started with the company’s overall KPIs and then developed product KPIs of our own. These included particular metrics (not shown here) around user adoption, retentions and specific deliverables we wanted to measure around user segment engagement.

### Information Architecture
Both the consumer-facing and internal-facing dashboards require a large amount of information. To ensure ease of use, I started with Information Architecture before moving into any design.

First, I took all captured requirements from the BA and placed them as cards on Trello. I then organized them by internal v. external, then again into lists. This helped establish a site map. Finally, to make sure I arranged everything the best way possible, I used TreeJack to conduct remote tree tests. In a tree test, you give users a series of items to find in your tree (usually navigation structure) and pay close attention to where they look. You’re able to analyze task success, completion rates, the time taken and other analysis.

* Card Sorting
* IA Map
* Tree Testing

### Dashboard Design
The dashboard designs focused on the consumer-facing application. Designs were responsive, usable and WCAG level AA compliant. I leveraged aspects of Material Design and iOS Human Interface Guidelines but did not entirely rely on either. I wanted a solution that felt updated and modern but still fit within the client’s overall ecosystem of applications. Consistency is especially important because the client wanted to entice clients to sign up for more than just life insurance. 

After I created wireframes and consulted with internal stakeholders, we ran usability tests. Due to the sensitive financial nature of user information, we used completely fake data. A usability testing plan was written by myself and then conducted remote and unmoderated through usertesting.com.

We were able to identify several areas where users became confused. Changes from usability testing included more user-friendly labels, separation of the dashboard overview and accounts, and placing settings and integrations more prominently in the menu.


* Wireframes
* Usability Testing
* Finalized Designs

## Future
Next steps include implementation of the consumer-facing dashboard, design of the internal dashboard, creation of a design pattern library and mobile apps.
